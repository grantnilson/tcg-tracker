## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

This proejct was built as a small tool for my friend and I to track the decks that we create for our TCG games, and to keep them ranked against each other. The application is still in a beta phase, but I'm adding mroe features as the days go on!
